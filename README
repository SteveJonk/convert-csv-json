Some requirements:

- Install python3
- Make sure to save your csv as utf-8 encoded (or you'll get errors)

Note:
The node script doesn't work yet.
Python does.

To run this, simply do the following:

1. Replace the contents of translations.csv with your own translations (make sure it's utf-8 encoded and that the first row is the keys)
2. Run the following command: `python3 convert.py`
3. Copy all current locales from the repo to the `locales` folder
4. Run the following command: `python3 combine.py`
5. The new locales will be in the `output` folder
6. Copy the contents of the `output` folder to the `locales` folder in the repo
